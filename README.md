- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @frank7171
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning what github is about. It looks like a source for me to work with NMEA 2000 coding, including reading and modifying for my boating. I have a Yamaha FSH210, which has lots of propritary code I'd like to decipher and then modify in order to move the display info to my Lowrance mdf's.
